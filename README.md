and text files are in the Code folder.

To produce the K-Means confusion matrices, elbow graphs, and text files containing the 
centroids, run k_means.py with no arguments

For all the EM matrices, graphs, and text file, run expectation_maximization.py with no
arguments.

To Run PCA reduction, run principle_component_analysis.py with no arguments.
To run ICA reduction, run independant_component_analysis.py with no arguments.
To run random projection reduction, run random_projections.py with no arguments.
To run SVD reduction, run svd_projection.py with no arguments.

To produce the 16 experiments required for running clustering algorithms on the reduced 
datasets, run cluster_reduced_data.py with no arguments.

To run the ANN model with the reduced datasets as well as with the datasets that have 
the clustered label appended, run ann_learning.py with no arguments.
